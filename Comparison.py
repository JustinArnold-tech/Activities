#Arithmetic Operators:
    #"+, -, *, /"
#Practice with Comparison Operator:

#So far the operators we have covered are:
#">" -> Greater Than
#"<" -> Less Than
#"==" -> Eguals (Hard Equality)
#">=" -> Greater than or Equal
#"<=" -> Less than or Equal

#Comparison Opertors Result in a Boolean Value

# sample1 = 4 > 9
# sample2 = 2 < 4

# print(sample1)
# print(sample2)

#Practice with Logical Operators:
# soulution = False and False
# print(soulution)

#Practicing with Control Flow or If Statements:
#Step 1: Write the keyword "if"
#Step 2: follow it with parentheses
#Step 3: Put a Colon at the end

# if(True):
#     name = "Justin"
#     print("Hellow World")
#     print("Justin")
#     print("Justin".lower())


# expression1 = 23 > 3
# expression2 = 98 < 200
# expression3 = "Justin" > "Ethereum"

# if(expression3):
#     print("Elon Musk messed up!")




#Creating website: If you sign up, you provide some username and password get stored in some database owned by that company you signed up for.
#When you try to log in AFTER you sign up. The process looks literally like this:
    #if username passed in IS EQUAL TO username in database provided at sign up:
        #Provide them their page

#Else practice. The ELSE block only runs if the "if" block doesn't.
#The IF BLOCK doesnt run if the exp

# expression1 = 23 > 3
# expression2 = 98 < 200
# expression3 = "Justin" > "Ethereum"

# if(expression3):
#     print("Elon Musk messed up!")
# else:
#     print("Elon Musk didn't mess up after all!")

#Elif practice.

# expression1 = 23 > 3
# expression2 = 98 < 200
# expression3 = "Justin" > "Ethereum"

# if(expression3):
#     print("Elon Musk messed up!")
# else:
#     print("Elon Musk didn't mess up after all!")

#Now we are working with chained conditionals:
    #WHCIH 

# expression1 = 7 == 7
# expression2 = 7 != 7
# expression3 = False
# expression4 = "Justin" == "justin"
# expression5 = "Justin" == "Justin"


# if(expression2):
#     print("I'm in the IF Statement WOO!")
# elif(expression3):
#     print("I'm in the ELIF statement WOO!")
# elif(expression4):
#     print("I'm, on")
# else:
#     print("Boo, I'm in the ELSE statment. This means the other two conditions HAVE to have failed....:(")


#ShortHand
# a = 10
# b = 4

# if a > b: print("A is greater") 
# else print("B is greater")

#Now we are working with Nested IF/Else Statements:
if(True):
    print("Hi")
    if(True):
        print("What it do")
    elif(False):
        print("KLK")
    else:
        print("What's up")
elif():
    if():
        print("Stuff1")
    elif(False):
        print("Stuff2")
    else:
        print("Stuff3")
else:
    if(True):
        print("bye")
    elif(True):
        print("peace")
    else:
        print("duces")
